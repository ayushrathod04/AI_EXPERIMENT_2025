Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
Both `max_new_tokens` (=256) and `max_length`(=100) seem to have been set. `max_new_tokens` will take precedence. Please refer to the documentation for more information. (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation)
