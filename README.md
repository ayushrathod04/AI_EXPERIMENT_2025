# AI & NLP Learning Journey ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository showcases my personal journey and projects in the world of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. My goal is to build intelligent applications by understanding core concepts of AI, machine learning, and how language models like GPT work â€” and applying that knowledge to real-world use cases.
